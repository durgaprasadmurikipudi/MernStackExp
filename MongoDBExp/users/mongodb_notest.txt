There is also discussion about mongoose here.
A model in mongoose may be like User model, deals with all the collections of 'User' present in the database.
Although the model name is singular, it represents all collections in the db.
Every model has a schema which tells us the fields for each isntance/record present in the collection and the type of each field,
optionally some metaproperties like required, etc. 

Each instance of user model has some librayr functions associated with them,
User.find({}) = you provide the fields in the find function in form of object,
it will find all the records that match the criteria and returns an array.
Each field in object param is matched against each record's respective field.
An empty object means return all records.

User.findOne({}) = just like above except that it only returns a single and first record that
 matches the criteria provided. An empty object is a command to fetch the first row.

const user = new User({ name: 'joe' })
user.save(); this save is again provided by the model and saves the model back to the users collection.
The model whenever it creates a new object, automatically assigns the id property, so even before we can access joe._id.toString()
to see its id, if you don't call toString() you will get a ObjectId instance.

There are 4 different kinds of remove.
One on model instance, if you got a reference to the model instance, like you already retrieved one from the database,
by findOne or some other read method, then you can call directly remove(), on that instance.

But if you do on User model, rather than instance like, USer.remove(), then you have to pass the criteria to it and it will
delete all the instances that match the criteria. If you want to delete the firstone that match the criteria, you can use
User.findOneAndRemove(). If you want to delete any object by id, there is a method for that as well, like findByIdAndRemove()

for update as well, the functions are like delete, excpet for one more function is added on to the model instance.
On model instance, you have update and 'set'-and-'save' function.
On User model, you have update, findOneAndUpdate, findByIdAndUpdate

Mongo operators are a big win***********************************

fail the test always atleast once.

Rather tahn sql like approach, user and posts model,
mongoo is user, a field in it is array of posts.*****
so for a nested  document, we might create a new schema but there will be only one model, user model

You know inlike joe.remove, joe.subdocument.remove() will not directly save it to database.
This remove on a field level is considered as a field change, and should be accompained with __instance__.save();

do you know that you can go to node src folder and open termianl from it, type in node, press enter
and require any mongoose model and assign it to a constant and refer it and access it, run methods on it ?
yea, now you know!

So far we have been storing posts in user model,
Think about this, now we wish to fetch random 10 posts..
What would you do?
User.find({}).then(users => users.flatMap(user => user.posts));

Now above query has so many flaws for getting random 10 posts, you are getting all users, suppose if you limit the query to
fetch first 10 suers, what if those 10 suers have never made any posts?
There could be otehr ways, but don't you think this is becoming unnecessarily hard than it has to be?
For example if there is a subdocument inside a document, we have this issues, what about a subdocument inside a subdocument
inside a document, liek array of comments inside posts inside user.
How would you handle a query like, get all the latest comments made by  user amanda ?
Solution, separate collections for each document, but that might involve multiple in and out db calls. 
So a trade off, try to have a balance between Embedded cocuments vs separate collections.

xit and it.only and root suite -> before is outside of all describe blocks.

suprisingly query is not executed unless you tail it with .then call.
So if you a query, User.findOne({ name: 'joe' }), it will not go to db and retrieve it, mongoose won't do it.
so this is the query part, tehre are also modifiers that we can attach to the query, this will work becuase, 
mongoose did not go to db as soon as query is made.
So if you say populate a ref field it will work.
